- Proper form handling with controlled components
- Visual distinction between completed and active tasks
- Smooth user interactions

### Enhanced Feature: Task Filtering (Required - 15 points)

Implement task filtering functionality:
- Display three filter buttons: "All", "Active", and "Completed"
- Filter tasks based on completion status when buttons are clicked
- Highlight the currently active filter button
- Update task counter to reflect the filtered view (e.g., "3 of 5 tasks" when showing completed)
- Default filter should be "All" showing all tasks

---

## Technical Requirements

### React Fundamentals
```jsx
// Example component structure
function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  
  const addTask = (taskText) => {
    // Add new task to state
  };
  
  const toggleTask = (id) => {
    // Toggle task completion
  };
  
  const deleteTask = (id) => {
    // Remove task from state
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <TaskForm onAddTask={addTask} />
      <TaskCounter tasks={tasks} />
      <TaskList 
        tasks={tasks} 
        onToggle={toggleTask}
        onDelete={deleteTask}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Task object structure
const task = {
  id: 1, // unique identifier
  text: "Learn React", // task description
  completed: false // completion status
};
```

### Styling Requirements
- Reuse your Assignment 1 CSS (copy to React project)
- Maintain responsive design
- Use className instead of class
- Keep visual consistency with original design

---

## Assignment Scope

This assignment focuses on React fundamentals:

✅ **Component-based architecture** - Break UI into reusable components
✅ **useState hook** - Manage application state
✅ **Props and data flow** - Pass data between components
✅ **Event handling** - Respond to user interactions
✅ **Controlled components** - Manage form inputs with React state

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup React Project
```bash
# Create new Vite project with React template
npm create vite@latest task-manager-react -- --template react

# Navigate to project directory
cd task-manager-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 2: Project Structure
```
task-manager-react/
├── index.html          # Root HTML file (in root, not public/)
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── src/
    ├── main.jsx        # Entry point (not index.js!)
    ├── App.jsx         # Main component
    ├── App.css
    └── components/
        ├── TaskList.jsx
        ├── TaskItem.jsx
        ├── TaskForm.jsx
        └── TaskCounter.jsx
```

### Step 3: Create Component Files
```bash
# Create components directory
mkdir src/components

# Create your component files
touch src/components/TaskForm.jsx
touch src/components/TaskCounter.jsx
touch src/components/TaskList.jsx
touch src/components/TaskItem.jsx
```

### Step 4: Development Approach
1. **Start with hard-coded data** - Test your components with sample tasks first
2. **Build component structure** - Get all components rendering before adding state
3. **Add state management** - Implement useState in App.jsx
4. **Connect event handlers** - Wire up add, toggle, delete functions
5. **Implement filtering** - Add filter buttons and logic
6. **Style and polish** - Copy your Assignment 1 CSS and adapt for React

## Implementation Guide

This guide provides concepts and hints to help you build the task manager. Try to solve each part yourself before looking at hints!

### Setting Up State in App.jsx

You'll need two pieces of state:

1. **Tasks array** - Stores all your tasks
   - Initial value: empty array `[]`
   - Each task is an object with: `id`, `text`, `completed`

2. **Filter string** - Tracks which filter is active
   - Initial value: `'all'`
   - Possible values: `'all'`, `'active'`, `'completed'`

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
  // TODO: Add your state here using useState
}
```

### Task Data Structure

Each task object should have these properties:
- `id` - Unique identifier (Hint: `Date.now()` or `crypto.randomUUID()`)
- `text` - The task description (string)
- `completed` - Boolean for completion status

### Key Functions to Implement in App.jsx

**1. Adding Tasks**

Think about:
- Creating a new task object with a unique id
- The completed property should start as `false`
- Adding the new task to the existing array (remember: don't mutate state!)

Hint: Use the spread operator `[...tasks, newTask]` to create a new array

**2. Toggling Tasks (Marking Complete/Incomplete)**

Think about:
- Finding the task by id
- Flipping its `completed` boolean
- Creating a new array with the updated task

Hint: `.map()` can create a new array where you transform one element

**3. Deleting Tasks**

Think about:
- Removing a task by its id
- Creating a new array without that task

Hint: `.filter()` creates a new array with only items that pass a test

**4. Filtering Tasks**

Think about:
- Based on the filter state, return different subsets of tasks
- 'all' → return everything
- 'active' → return tasks where completed is false
- 'completed' → return tasks where completed is true

Hint: Use if statements and `.filter()` to return different arrays

### Building Components

**TaskForm Component**

This component needs:
- Its own local state for the input value (controlled component)
- A form with onSubmit handler
- An input with value and onChange props
- Validation to prevent empty tasks
- Clear the input after submission

Key concepts:
- `e.preventDefault()` stops form from refreshing page
- Controlled components: input value comes from state
- Call the `onAddTask` prop function with the text
- Use `.trim()` to check for empty/whitespace-only input

**TaskItem Component**

This component receives a task via props and displays:
- A checkbox (type="checkbox") that calls onToggle when changed
- The task text with conditional styling
- A delete button that calls onDelete when clicked

Key concepts:
- Use `checked={task.completed}` for checkbox
- Apply a CSS class conditionally for completed tasks
- Pass `task.id` when calling the handler functions

**TaskList Component**

This component receives filtered tasks and handlers via props.

Think about:
- What should render when the tasks array is empty?
- How do you render multiple TaskItem components?
- What prop is required when rendering lists in React?

Key concepts:
- Use `.map()` to transform array of tasks into array of components
- Each component in a list needs a unique `key` prop
- Pass down the handler functions as props

**TaskCounter Component**

This component calculates and displays statistics.

Think about:
- How to count total tasks (array length)
- How to count completed tasks (use `.filter()`)
- How to calculate active tasks (total - completed)

Display these three numbers in your UI.

### Filter Buttons

Think about:
- Rendering three buttons for 'all', 'active', 'completed'
- Each button should update the filter state when clicked
- The active button should have a special CSS class
- Use conditional logic to apply the 'active' class

Hint: Use a ternary operator `className={filter === 'all' ? 'active' : ''}`

### React Concepts You'll Use

**State Management:**
- `useState()` hook for managing data
- Never mutate state directly - always create new arrays/objects
- Use setter functions to update state

**Props:**
- Pass data down from parent to child components
- Pass functions down so children can communicate back up
- Destructure props in function parameters: `function TaskForm({ onAddTask })`

**Event Handling:**
- onClick for buttons
- onChange for inputs
- onSubmit for forms
- Always pass a function, not a function call: `onClick={handleClick}` not `onClick={handleClick()}`

**Controlled Components:**
- Input value comes from state
- onChange updates that state
- This gives React control over the input

**Lists and Keys:**
- Use `.map()` to render arrays of components
- Always provide a unique `key` prop
- Keys help React track which items changed

### Common React Patterns

**Creating new arrays (don't mutate):**
```jsx
// Add to array
const newArray = [...oldArray, newItem];

// Update item in array
const newArray = oldArray.map(item =>
  item.id === targetId ? { ...item, updated: true } : item
);

// Remove from array
const newArray = oldArray.filter(item => item.id !== targetId);
```

**Conditional rendering:**
```jsx
// Show different content based on condition
{tasks.length === 0 ? <EmptyMessage /> : <TaskList />}

// Conditional CSS class
<div className={isActive ? 'active' : ''}>
```

**Passing functions with parameters:**
```jsx
// When you need to pass an argument to a handler
onClick={() => handleDelete(task.id)}

// Not just onClick={handleDelete} because we need to pass the id
```

## Tips for Success

### Development Strategy
1. **Start Simple**: Get basic components rendering first
2. **One Feature at a Time**: Don't try to implement everything at once
3. **Use React DevTools**: Install browser extension for debugging
4. **Test Frequently**: Check your app after each small change

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't mutate state directly (use setter functions)
- Remember to use `key` props in lists
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Don't forget to handle edge cases (empty lists, etc.)

### React Patterns to Use
```jsx
// Conditional rendering
{tasks.length === 0 ? <p>No tasks yet!</p> : <TaskList tasks={tasks} />}

// List rendering
{tasks.map(task => <TaskItem key={task.id} task={task} />)}

// Event handling
<button onClick={() => deleteTask(task.id)}>Delete</button>

// Task filtering pattern
const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all');

const filteredTasks = tasks.filter(task => {
  if (filter === 'active') return !task.completed;
  if (filter === 'completed') return task.completed;
  return true; // 'all'
});

// Render filtered tasks
{filteredTasks.map(task => <TaskItem key={task.id} task={task} />)}
```
